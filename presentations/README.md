## Project Summary

This project implements a Short Horizon Actor-Critic (SHAC) algorithm for optimal control of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTR) under time-varying electricity pricing.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed novel RL approach for chemical process control
- Integrated economic optimization with safety constraints
- Demonstrated significant cost savings while maintaining operational safety

**Technologies Used:** Python, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, Process Control, Optimization
