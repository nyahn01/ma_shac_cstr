# Academic Project Structure Guide

This repository follows academic best practices for Master's thesis research. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the research workflow.

## Quick Navigation

- **üìñ [thesis/](thesis/)** - Thesis manuscript and writing
- **üéØ [presentations/](presentations/)** - Slides and presentation materials  
- **üñ•Ô∏è [source/](source/)** - Implementation code
- **üß™ [experiments/](experiments/)** - Experimental work and configs
- **üìä [data/](data/)** - Datasets and data management
- **üìà [results/](results/)** - Generated results and analysis
- **üìö [docs/](docs/)** - Documentation and meeting notes
- **üîß [utils/](utils/)** - Utility functions and scripts

## Research Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
```bash
# Document research plan
docs/timeline/research_plan.md
docs/meeting_notes/YYYY-MM-DD_kickoff.md

# Set up initial experiments
experiments/exp001_baseline/
```

### 2. Implementation Phase  
```bash
# Develop core algorithms
source/agent.py
source/environment.py

# Create configurations
experiments/exp001_baseline/config.py

# Write tests
tests/test_*.py
```

### 3. Experimentation Phase
```bash
# Run experiments
python experiments/exp001_baseline/run_experiment.py

# Analyze results
results/analysis_notebooks/exp001_analysis.ipynb

# Generate figures
results/figures/thesis_figures/
```

### 4. Writing Phase
```bash
# Write thesis chapters
thesis/chapters/01_introduction.tex

# Create presentations
presentations/progress_reports/

# Generate final figures
python scripts/generate_thesis_figures.py
```

### 5. Defense Phase
```bash
# Prepare defense materials
presentations/defense/

# Final thesis compilation
thesis/compiled/final_thesis.pdf
```

## Git Workflow for Academics

### Branch Strategy
```bash
main                    # Stable, working version
chapter/introduction    # Writing branches
experiment/exp001      # Experiment branches
presentation/defense   # Presentation branches
analysis/statistics    # Analysis branches
```

### Typical Commands
```bash
# Start new work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b experiment/exp002-improved-gae

# Save progress
git add .
git commit -m "experiment: implement improved GAE (exp002)

Configuration:
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- GAE lambda: 0.95
- Episode length: 32

Results:
- Training converged in 15k episodes
- 12% improvement over baseline"

# Integrate successful work
git checkout main
git merge experiment/exp002-improved-gae
git tag exp002-improved-gae
git push origin main --tags
```

## Academic Commit Conventions

## Collaboration Guidelines

### With Supervisors
1. **Regular Updates**: Push changes frequently
2. **Clear Commits**: Descriptive commit messages
3. **PDF Access**: Include compiled documents
4. **Meeting Notes**: Document all discussions

### With Peers
1. **Code Reviews**: Use pull requests for major changes
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README files
3. **Reproducibility**: Clear setup instructions
4. **Sharing**: Easy experiment replication
